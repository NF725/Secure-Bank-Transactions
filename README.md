Using Facial Recognition to Authenticate users in Bank Transactions (Simulation)
I have tried to incorporate Facial Recognition into Bank Transaction Simulation as a method of Two-Factor-Authentication to proceed to Transactions.

main.py needs to be executed. First page is the registration page to enter details of users, followed by Take Images and Train Images buttons to store the faces of users and train. In ATM gateway, after entering card details, frame for Facial Recognition opens, after which the authentication leads to functions of Withdraw, Deposit and Balance.
